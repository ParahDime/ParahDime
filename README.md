## Welcome to my little webpage 👋

<!--
**ParahDime/ParahDime** is a ✨ _special_ ✨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Here are some ideas to get you started: -->
  Who am i?
  
  I'm Dec, a 20 something year old working on my coding career. I have a computer science degree

  My technical focus is around data and language expertise, giving me a broad use of code and using it to its full potential.

  Due to my background being extremely hands on, it allows me to have skills other developers wish they had (such as my glossy beard😉).


  
🔭 What am i working on?
  
  Currently I'm working on my portfolio and expanding my understanding of other programming languages, fun i know. 
  
  I'm currently working on projects to develop an understanding of algorithms, with a mini route finder, allowing for various methods for searching, grounding my understanding on algorithms and O notation, as well as building a few 'key' projects, one being my portfolio website.

🌱 What am i learning & reading?
  
  Reading: The 5am club by Robin Sharma, helping me build better habits
            
  How money works, helping me have a better understanding of finances
  
  Learning: Algorithms, including Breadth and depth search
            
  Time management
            
 🤔 What skills can i bring from my current job?
 
 Currently i work as a contractor and tutor in the evening, so there's a lot i can bring.

 Working as a contractor helps me build my hard skills. Resilience and 'out of the box' thinking is one, i mean i've mended brickwork with just a pencil (no joke).
 
 Tutoring helps me reinforce my IT skills, usually working as the base level helping deepen my understanding of universal coding concepts.

 🤔 What do i need to improve the most?
   
   Working beyond my comfort zone. My github has been a bit barren until october 2025 as i've been so busy managing other aspects of my life that took precadent. 
  
   I do need to work on handling APIs and expanding beyond my current languages, but that's an easy fix with how fast i've accelerated my self improvement.

📫 Want to send me a message?
  
  I'm more than happy for people to send me a message to help connect and grow together, shoot me a message on here. I don't bite🥳

⚡ A little fun fact for you:
  
  You know i do enjoy a cheeky bit of artwork. I'm skilled at greyscale, ink, watercolour AND a bit of digital. Helps with detail spotting.
